      "Crumbl Corp is highly innovative, yet FP & Corp motivations do not always align. To effectively address challenges, we must unite and speak with one voice. Without a united front, we risk working in isolation, undermining our collective strength."
  - desc:
      "We joined the association to be able to help our business grow and work with other franchise partners to better ourselves and each other as owners. Since corporate’s culture is far from a partnership and continues to make decisions based on their own corporate strategy, we believe this association would bring us together for positive change which would not be possible as individual owners. We want to be part of the bigger picture and the association allows us to do so as a collective voice."
  - desc:
      "Because of the disconnect between Franchise Partners' financial success coming from net profits of the individual store, and Corporate's financial success coming from revenue, I feel like Franchise Partners need a bigger voice to communicate the pain points of achieving profitability. There is also a lot of knowledge from in-store operations nationwide that corporate needs to rely on."
  - desc:
      "The association has been very helpful to my store in a variety of ways, but one of the biggest benefits I have seen is that we are able to gain insight, ideas, and advice in an instant from owners who are in their stores every day. It’s so valuable to learn from other store experts especially when the instructions from corporate are insufficient or unclear.
